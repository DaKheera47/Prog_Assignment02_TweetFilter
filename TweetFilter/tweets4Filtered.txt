Some people may hate it, but I think B**k to the Future is the gr*atest movie of all time! It has an awe*ome soundtrack and an iconic c*r. 
Guess the film: if o*e is to understand the gr*at mystery, o*e must study all its aspects, not just the d*gmatic narrow view of the Jediâ€¦ Learn to know the dark side of the Force, and you will be a**e to save your wife from certain death. 
Does anybody know what throwing the cat amongst the pigeons means? It seems quite mean to me! 
Sometimes, using lots of large words leads to an overcomplication of the topic, consequently mea*ing identification and solidification of the true intention of the sentence becomes difficult. What really is needed is a simplification without unnecessary fantastication. 
If you have made it this far, your program must be really sta**e - which is awe*ome! :-)
